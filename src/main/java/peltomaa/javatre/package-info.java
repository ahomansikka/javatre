Java binding for <a href = "http://laurikari.net/tre/">TRE</a> regular expression library

In addition, this package has few classes to make using
<a href = "http://laurikari.net/tre/">TRE</a> 
more Java-like, BUT the classes are not compatible with Java regular expressions
(package {@code java.util.regex}).<p>

File {@code src/test/java/peltomaa/javatre/JavaTRETest.java} has some examples.
